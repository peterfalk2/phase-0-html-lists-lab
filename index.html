    Okay, so we've got our grilled cheese ingredients, but what about the steps required to make a grilled cheese? Steps to a recipe need to be in order, otherwise we may end up with burnt cheese covered in bread and topped with a square of butter. The steps to making a basic grilled cheese would be:
    <ol>
      <li>Spread butter on bread and frying pan</li>
      <li>Place bread in frying pan and fry</li>
      <li>Add cheese on top of bread</li>
      <li>Cover with second slice of bread</li>
      <li>Turn over and fry for 2 minutes</li>
    </ol>
